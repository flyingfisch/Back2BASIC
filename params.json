This will help BASIC programmers switch to lua, as well as making it more straightforward to port BASIC programs to lua.\r\n\r\n## 2. Already implemented\r\n* b2b.menu (a prefabricated menu function)\r\n* b2b.printText (like \"HELLO\" in BASIC, but with LESS-style page breaks)\r\n* b2b.locate (like locate in BASIC)\r\n* b2b.ygraph (Y= graph)\r\n* b2b.inputString (get user input)\r\n\r\n## 3. To be implemented\r\n_[Help ](http://community.casiocalc.org/topic/7095-back2basic-a-luazm-library/) [me come ](http://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8883&highlight=) [up with ideas!](http://www.omnimaga.org/index.php?topic=15874)_\r\n\r\n## 4. Usage\r\nMake a folder called \"lib\" in your root directory. Put b2b.lua in this folder.\r\nIn the program you wish to use the library, put _run([[lib\\b2b.lua]])_ at the top.\r\n\r\n## 5. Function syntax\r\nCan be found in README.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
